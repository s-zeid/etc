Notes
-----

* Usually, on Linux, to apply changes to your `.XCompose` file, you must log out
  and back in or reboot.  If your system uses ibus, you may be able to apply
  changes without logging out or rebooting by running `ibus restart`.
  
  To check if your system is using ibus, run `ps x | grep ibus-daemon` and look
  for an `ibus-daemon` process.
