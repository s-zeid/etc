Notes
-----

* Usually, on Linux, to apply changes to your `.XCompose` file, you must log out
  and back in or reboot.  If your system uses ibus, you may be able to apply
  changes without logging out or rebooting by running `ibus restart`.
  
  To check if your system is using ibus, run `ps x | grep ibus-daemon` and look
  for an `ibus-daemon` process.

* To check for errors in an XCompose file:

  `xkbcli compile-compose --test [file]`

  If the file is omitted, then the default XCompose file will be checked.

  To install xkbcli:

      alpine# apk add xkbcli
      debian# apt install libxkbcommon-tools
      fedora# dnf install libxkbcommon-utils

  There is also a Python script in this repository at <./\_bin/xcompose-check>
  which uses xkbcommon via ctypes to do the same checks.
